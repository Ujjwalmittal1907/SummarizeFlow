## üìñ Why Video Summarizer?

In today's fast-paced world, managing time efficiently is a constant challenge. Whether you're a student preparing for exams, a professional reviewing meeting recordings, or a casual learner exploring new topics, lengthy videos can be a bottleneck to productivity.  

Long videos often include pauses, repeated content, or unnecessary elaborations, making it difficult to extract the core ideas quickly. Watching such videos end-to-end can be time-consuming and impractical for people with packed schedules.  

**Video Summarizer** directly addresses this issue by:  
- Enabling users to focus on key information without wading through irrelevant details.  
- Supporting better learning outcomes by allowing quick reviews of critical points.  
- Reducing cognitive load by presenting only the most essential parts of the video.  

This application empowers users to manage their time more effectively while ensuring they don't miss out on the valuable content within lengthy recordings.

## üöÄ How It Works

### Step-by-Step Workflow

1. **Upload a Video**: 
   - Users upload a video through a simple web interface.  
   - Supported file formats include `.mp4`, `.mkv`, and more.

2. **Processing**:  
   - The system extracts keyframes and transcribes the audio track using state-of-the-art audio-to-text technologies.  
   - Text and visuals are analyzed to ensure context and relevance.

3. **NLP Analysis**:  
   - The transcribed text is processed using an NLP model to identify key topics, phrases, and themes.  
   - This ensures the summarized version retains the video's essential message and structure.

4. **Generate Summary**:  
   - A summarized video is created by combining selected keyframes, audio clips, and transitions.  
   - Redundant segments are eliminated to reduce the duration.

5. **Download or View**:  
   - Users can either download the summarized video or view it directly within the platform.
